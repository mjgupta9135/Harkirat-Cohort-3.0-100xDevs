1.Why do we need react ?
-> For static website we dont need react but in case of dynamic website we need react.

React is just an easier way to write normal HTML/CSS/JS.
Its a new syntax that under hood gets converted into HTML/CSS/JS.

* Some React Jargon
1. State     --> An object that represents the current state of the app. It represents the dynamic things in our app.(Like Variable)
2. Component --> How a DOM element should render,given a state.It is a re-usable dynamic and HTML snippit that changes given a state.


JSX: -> JSX stands for Javascript XML. It is a syntax extension for Javascript,most commonly used with React.
     -> JSX allows you to write HTML-Like code directly within  Javascript. This makes it easier t create and manage the user interface in React application.
