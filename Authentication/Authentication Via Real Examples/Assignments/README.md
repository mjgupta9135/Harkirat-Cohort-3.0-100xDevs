This week is divided into three parts for assignments -

## JWTs

- Write a function that takes in a username and password and returns a JWT token with the username encoded. Should return null if the username is not a valid email or if the password is less than 6 characters. Try using the zod library here
- Write a function that takes a jwt as input and returns true if the jwt can be DECODED (not verified). Return false otherwise
- Write a function that takes a jwt as input and returns true if the jwt can be VERIFIED. Return false otherewise
- To test, go to the 02-jwt folder and run `npx jest ./tests`
